<p>Per <a href="https://www.clarkconstruction.com/news/clark-kicks-strategic-partnership-program-seattle">Clark’s press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Earlier this month, Clark launched its Strategic Partnership Program in Seattle. The four-month program, which is offered at no cost to local small business owners, provides comprehensive construction management and business skills training. More than 10 small businesses – and 19 participates – are enrolled in the inaugural Seattle class. Clark first developed the Strategic Partnership Program in 2006. The intensive, MBA-style course includes a curriculum of weekly classes, supplemented by experiential learning. Clark employees and industry experts work with program participants to review the fundamentals of project management, estimating, purchasing, basic accounting and financial reporting, bonding and insurance requirements, and how to read and understand contracts. Now in its 11th year, the Strategic Partnership Program is offered in several markets across the country and has more than 400 graduates. The Seattle program will culminate this summer with a capstone project.</blockquote>

<p>During the final month of the Capstone Project, Molinas Construction President/Owner David Molina teamed up with Jon Burris (Kathon Services), Jan Keiser (Keiser Group) and Cybill Edwards (Goldbelt Operations Support Services) to bid on a mock proposal for the Battalion Barracks Complex, a two-level government-owned, government-operated facility providing metal stud framing, insulation, drywall installation, finishing and acoustical ceiling services.</p>

<p>During the capstone project, John served as Co-Owner/Project Manager, Jan was Quality/Safety Manager, David as Superintendent, and Cybill as Contract Administration, and in the final presentation briefed senior executives from Clark Construction Group, Lease Crutcher Lewis, and Community Outreach Partners.</p>
