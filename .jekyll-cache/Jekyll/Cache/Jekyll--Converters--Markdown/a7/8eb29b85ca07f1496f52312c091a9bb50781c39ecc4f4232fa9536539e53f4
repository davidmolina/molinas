I"Y<p>WALLA WALLA, Wash. - Today, Molinas Construction Company has completed a monumental task on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <a href="http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/Missions/Projects/Mill-Creek-Levee-Maintenance/">Mill Creek Levee Project, Phase I</a>. The Molinas team successfully and safely cleared 6 acres of woody vegetation from the landward side of the levees on a 5,000-foot section of the Walla Walla flood-control structure. Restoring the federally managed section of the Mill Creek Levee System to meet national safety standards was conducted in two phases, southside and northside, and through the process, the team discovered abandoned utilities, including culverts and concrete debris, from generations past. In total, the scope of work included the removal of several hundred cottonwood and locust trees, and dense vegetation material.</p>
