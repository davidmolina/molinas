<p>Molinas always puts the safety of the public, our project partners, and our people above all. Before starting work on any project, we perform an Activity Hazard Analysis as well as a detailed Site Specific Safety Plan which enables us to proactively identify and communicate potential hazards to the project and field teams. We communicate these AHAs to the Contracting Officer's Representative and then ensure everyone abides by them.</p>

<p>To us, no project is successful unless it is executed safely. We believe that all accidents, no matter their seriousness, are preventable, and through proper planning and training, team engagement and empowerment, and constant vigilance, we can ensure that everyone leaves the jobsite to their families and return the next day to do it over again.</p>
