<h3>Work With Us</h3>
<p>Are you ready to join the family of Molinas Construction Company? Read on.</p>

<h2>Raise the Bar in Federal Contracting</h2>
<p>At Molinas, you'll get to work side-by-side with former Army Captain David Molina to meet the company's customers demands and ensure the train is firing on all cylinders. Productivity and efficiency is essential. It's in our DNA, and it must be yours.</p>

<p>We have done jobs all across the country, large and small, and are not afraid to reach to new heights. Our current financial ability to do purchase orders and move equipment or material for our customers is the latest in reaching new heights.</p>

<h2>Work with the Best and Brightest</h2>
<p>There is no "me" or "cannot" in team. We're one-team, one-fight, and everyone on the team plays a key role in working towards the common goal.</p>

<p>As a family owned and operated business, we've launched multiple companies in our past, from staffing to technology companies, and are relentless in holding ourselves to high standards and ensuring our values of integrity, excellence, teamwork, commitment and sustainability come to life in everything we do.</p>

<p>We are always looking for individuals who show intiative, loyalty, hard work, and enterprise. As a family owned business with small children, we're family friendly. That means we have flexible hours and don't over work our people into the ground. This ensures a healthy work/life balance so that we can go back to our families everyday and return the next day and do it over again.</p>

<p>At Molinas, we're performance-based and initiative driven. Once you get to know us, there’s little chance you’ll want to work for another family owned business in the federal contracting space. And, the Portland, Oregon area is a very nice place to raise a family.</p>

<h2>Our Culture</h2>
<p>At Molinas, you'll be empowered to own decisions, big and small, to meet the goals of our clients, general contractors and subcontractors. When you start your career at Molinas, you will help define and advance projects and deliverables, work in a collaborative environment and engage in meaningful work right out of the gate. We look for self-motivated individuals who possess a strong work ethic, discipline and razor-sharp focus.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>In addition to good pay, you'll operate in an unique entrepreneurial and decentralized operating environment while getting opportunities to learn, grow, and be recognized for your contributions. This means if you need to step out for a bit to one of the many cafes in the area and do your work, by all means.</p>

<p>You'll also find we make wellness and staying in shape easier. An on-site exercise room with showers is in the building. Bring your running shoes and leverage the lockers. Our office location boasts a nice area for morning runs.</p>

<p>All that to say, we're easy access to I-405 and along along the MAX line. That means if you're coming from either Gresham or Hillsboro, we're conveniently located so you don't have to pay for parking. If you do drive in, on-site parking is available and plenty of off-street parking as well.</li>

<p>The greatest benefit: walking distance to the very best Portland food trucks, restaurants and donut shops.</p>

<p>Finally, we're big believers in professional growth. We'll encourage you all along the way so that as we grow, you grow as well and take on greater responsibilites, from estimating to field operations.</p>
