<h3>History</h3>
<p>Molinas Construction Company ("Molinas") is a family-owned and operated leading provider of construction material & equipment to government customers. The company was founded in 2015 on a shoestring budget and $3,000 loan. Founded by former Army Captain David Molina, Molinas has grown out of the family's garage to work on federal projects procuring mission critical material & equipment globally. David went into federal contracting shortly after exiting active-duty at Dover Air Force Base in 2013.<p>

<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, Molinas has grown steadily with experience. In 2015, Molinas launched with the Mill Creek Levee Vegetation Maintenance Phase I project that propelled the company forward. This was the first major public works project by Molinas providing the owner project executive, project management, supervision, quality assurance, and day-to-day foreman experience. In early 2017, Molinas was awarded a 5-year IDIQ at Willamette National Cemetery with our founder operating a 316E CAT excavator to remove and load over 3,000 cubic yards annually. Year after year, Molinas experience has grown to support general contractors and agency requirements, from material handling equipment to specialty equipment for warfighters. In every role, Molinas fosters a spirit of innovation, cooperation and mutual respect toward a common goal: the end user. Known for building lasting and deep relationships, Molinas is dedicated to supporting sustainable infrastructure projects that move people, commerce and water. At Molinas we take great pride in doing everything we can to improve delivery.</p>
