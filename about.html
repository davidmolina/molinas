<h4>David Molina, President/Owner</h4>
<p>David Molina founded Molinas Construction Company in 2015 after serving over a decade in uniform as an Army enlisted soldier and officer. As a Captain in his last active-duty assignment, David proudly served as the S-2/3 OIC (Plans, Training & Operations Officer) at Dover Air Force Base in support of the Families of the Fallen mission culminating over a decade in uniform earning the Army Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, and Lt. Rowan Award. Throughout a decade as a citizen-soldier (2000-2014), David served as a Private in the 364th Civil Affairs Brigade, as a 2nd Lt and Summary Court Martial Officer at the Joint Personal Effects Depot-Casualty Mortuary Affairs Operations Center, and Aide-de-Camp to the Assistant Division Commander-Operations at the 104th Division (IT).</p>
